## 'Git init' is like creating a new folder for your project on your computer, but this folder is special because it keeps track of all the changes you make to your files. It's the first step you usually take when starting a new project.

## What is Version Control? ---> 'Version control' is like having a time machine for your work. It keeps track of all the changes you make to your files, so you can go back to an earlier version if you need to. It's also helpful when working with others, as it lets everyone see what changes have been made and work together without stepping on each other's toes.

## Why use Version Control? ---> 'Version control' is like a safety net for your software. It helps you keep track of all the changes you and your team make, so you can fix mistakes or go back to an earlier version if needed. It also makes it easy for everyone to work together on the same project without messing up each other's work. Think of it as a way to keep your code organized and safe.

## Git vs Other VCS. ---> Git is the most popular way to keep track of changes in software development, but there are other options too. (i) Mercurial is similar to Git but works a little differently (centralized approach and doesn't use hashes for tracking changes). (ii) Subversion is older and needs a central server to work. (iii) Perforce is for big projects and has extra features (centralized approach and has features like build automation and issue tracking). (iv) CVS is really old and not used much anymore (often considered outdated).
