## The 'git init' command creates a new Git repository. It can convert an existing, unversioned project to a Git repository or initialize a new, empty repository. Most other Git commands are unavailable outside of an initialized repository, so this is usually the first command youâ€™ll run in a new project.

## Version control is a system that manages and tracks file changes over time, allowing multiple people to collaborate on a project while maintaining a history of all modifications. It records changes to files, such as code, documents, or configuration files, and stores them in a repository. With version control, developers can revert to previous versions, compare differences between versions, and understand the evolution of a project. It supports features like branching, where different lines of development can occur independently, and merging, which combines changes from different branches. Overall, version control ensures that changes are organized, recoverable, and easily managed, making it a critical tool in software development and collaborative projects.
